# 🩺 MyHealthMate
**AI-powered Medical Paper Simplifier & Symptom Expert System**

MyHealthMate is a web application designed to **bridge the gap between complex medical information and everyday understanding**.  
It has two core features:

1. **Medical Paper Simplifier** – Upload a research paper or paste medical text, and MyHealthMate generates:
   - A concise abstract
   - Patient-friendly explanations
   - Suggested follow-up questions to discuss with a doctor

2. **Symptom Expert System** – Enter your symptoms, and MyHealthMate provides:
   - A ranked list of **possible causes** (not a diagnosis)
   - Recommended **tests** to confirm or rule out conditions
   - **Triage guidance** (self-care, consult GP, or emergency care)

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This tool is for **educational purposes only** and **not a substitute for professional medical advice**.  
> Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.
